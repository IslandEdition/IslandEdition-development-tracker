# Guide: Build a local real estate development news app
This guide will let you build a real estate development tracker as an evergreen news app. It is based on our work building the [Detroit Development Tracker](https://developmenttracker.detourdetroiter.com/). 

The guide is hosted on a blank, open-source template site you will be able to customize to build a tracker for your city, using open-source or freemium tools. It is designed for small local news publishers who want to bootstrap a news app, but anyone is welcome to try it out. Read the guide to learn how and get started.

This guide was produced by Jimmy McBroom and Kate Abbey-Lambertz as part of her Reynolds Journalism institute fellowship through Detour Detroit. It is based on their work building the Detroit Development Tracker, now maintained by Outlier Media. It is in progress as of March 2022, and will be complete in April 2022.
