# Guide: Build a local real estate development news app

***Last updated March 2022.***

This guide will let you build a real estate development tracker as an evergreen news app fueled by reader engagement. It is based on our work building the [Detroit Development Tracker](https://developmenttracker.detourdetroiter.com/) for Detour Detroit, now maintained by [Outlier Media](https://outliermedia.org/).

The guide is hosted on a blank, open-source template site you will be able to customize to build a tracker for your city, using open-source or freemium tools. It is designed for small local news publishers with limited resources who want to bootstrap a news app, but anyone is welcome to try it out. Read the guide to learn how and get started.

This guide was produced by Jimmy McBroom and Kate Abbey-Lambertz with support from the [Reynolds Journalism Institute](https://rjionline.org/), through Kate's 2021 RJI fellowship.

We started building the Detroit Development Tracker in 2021 with the goal to empower Detroiters to better understand the forces shaping their own neighborhoods. As development activity skyrockets in the city, we believe residents deserve more information about what is being built, and who is building it.

We hope that tracking larger scale residential and commercial development projects will give Detroiters another layer of understanding about land use and ownership in their neighborhoods. The Detroit Development Tracker takes this information out of the domain of developers, funders and city bureaucracy, making it more accessible — and actionable — for those most impacted by it.

The tracker launched in beta in February 2022. Though Jimmy is a civic engineer who lead development on the project, Detour did did not have a full-time developer, data journalist or product and design roles on our staff. Detour, which recently joined with Outlier, was a small local startup with a micro-budget that made it difficult to take on new resource- and time-intensive reporting projects without dedicated funding. We know, from our relationships with other publishers in groups like Local Independent Online News and the Institute for Nonprofit News, that our situation isn’t unique. 

So as we built the Detroit Development Tracker, we thought about how we could make it useful for others. Enter this template site and guide – which, we hope, will let you create a development tracker with relatively limited support needed on the design and development side, so you can focus on the reporting. 

The development tracker is one model for data-driven, equitable real estate and development journalism for underserved communities that you can use to strengthen your service journalism and relationships with readers while filling information gaps. 

If that sounds like a project that might benefit your newsroom, readers and community, we hope you’ll give it a try, and tell us how it goes. Read on to see how.
