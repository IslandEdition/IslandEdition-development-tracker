# Setting up the site

## Create your own copy of this site

- Fork this repository, using the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.
- You may want to [rename your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository) to something more meaningful.
- From a terminal, clone your newly-forked repository to your local computer, using your Git username and repository name instead of the placeholders here:

```
git clone git@github.com:<my-github-username>/<my-repository-name>.git
```

- This should create a new folder, `<my-repository-name>`, in the current directory.
- Change into that folder, which is the root directory of your new site:

```
cd <my-repository-name>
```

Before you can begin development, you'll have to make changes to two files that sit at the root of your site.

## Configuring `.env.development.local`

`.env.development.local` contains environment variables used in your application. These are principally API tokens that are used to connect to Airtable, Mapbox, and Supabase.

This file will **not** be committed to GitHub, since it contains sensitive information -- That's why it's included in the `.gitignore` file.

You will eventually want these environment variables to live in Netlify; more on that later!

### Airtable configuration

You should already have an Airtable account; the next step is to get your personal API key and the ID of your Base.

1. Find your API key on your [Airtable account page](https://airtable.com/account). You will have to click the purple input box to reveal the API key.
2. Copy this value as the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`.
3. Find the ID of your base: from the [Airtable API documentation](https://airtable.com/api), select your base; the base ID, which starts with `app` is the value you need.
4. Copy this value as the `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`.

### Mapbox configuration

[Mapbox]() is used for the map on the site, as well as to geocode the [addresses](./setting-up-and-using-your-base#project-field-address) attached to each project.

1. Sign up for an account [here](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/)
2. On the main [account page](https://account.mapbox.com/), click 'Create a token' to create a new access token.
3. Copy that access token as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

### Supabase configuration

#### Configuring Supabase bucket

1. Create a Supabase account, using your GitHub profile.
2. Create a new project, named `development-tracker.`
3. Create a new storage bucket, named `report-photos`. Make sure that the "public bucket" option is checked.
4. Go to "Policies", under "Configuration", and create a "New policy" on the `report-photos` bucket.
5. Choose "Create a policy from scratch".

Create a new policy that looks like this: `SELECT` and `INSERT` should be checked.

#### Supabase environment variables

6. Navigate to your Supabase project settings, which is the gear icon on the bottom of the left-hand sidebar.
7. Click "API" under "Project Settings".
8. Copy, the `anon` `public` API key, starting with `ey`, as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
9. Copy the URL of the Supabase project, including the `.supabase.co` suffix, under "Configuration", as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: 

Congrats! You've configured all the underlying services - you're ready to run the development server.

## Start the development server

Now that you're done configuring the site, it's time to run a development server locally so you can make changes to the site and test those changes on your local machine, before pushing those changes to your GitHub repository.

Make sure your project is open in  run the following command: `npm run dev`.

You should see a message in the terminal:

```bash
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
```

Go to your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` -- you should see a live copy of the site!
