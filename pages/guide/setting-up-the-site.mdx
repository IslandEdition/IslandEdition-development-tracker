# Setting up the site

Before you can begin development, you'll have to make changes to two files that sit at the root of your site.

## Configuring `.env.development.local`

`.env.development.local` contains environment variables used in your application. These are principally API tokens that are used to connect to Airtable, Mapbox, and Supabase.

This file will **not** be committed to GitHub, since it contains sensitive information -- That's why it's included in the `.gitignore` file.

You will eventually want these environment variables to live in Netlify; more on that later!

### Airtable configuration

You should already have an Airtable account; the next step is to get your personal API key and the ID of your Base.

1. Find your API key on your [Airtable account page](https://airtable.com/account). You will have to click the purple input box to reveal the API key.
2. Copy this value as the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`.
3. TK Find the ID of your Base
4. TK Copy this value.

### Mapbox configuration

Mapbox is fairly simple to set up:

1. Sign up for an account [here](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/)
2. On the main [account page](https://account.mapbox.com/), click 'Create a token' to create a new access token.
3. Copy that access token as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

### Supabase configuration

#### Configuring Supabase bucket

1. Create a Supabase account, using your GitHub profile.
2. Create a new project, named `development-tracker.`
3. Create a new storage bucket, named `report-photos`. Make sure that the "public bucket" option is checked.
4. Go to "Policies", under "Configuration", and create a "New policy" on the `report-photos` bucket.
5. Choose "Create a policy from scratch".

Create a new policy that looks like this: `SELECT` and `INSERT` should be checked.

#### Supabase environment variables

6. Navigate to your Supabase project settings, which is the gear icon on the bottom of the left-hand sidebar.
7. Click "API" under "Project Settings".
8. Copy, the `anon` `public` API key, starting with `ey`, as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
9. Copy the URL of the Supabase project, including the `.supabase.co` suffix, under "Configuration", as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: 

Supabase is now all set up!

## Configuring `toolkit.config.js`

- This contains basic sitewide configuration data
- The defaults are set up for the Detroit area, but you will need to change them.

It looks like this:

```
module.exports = {
  siteTitle: `Airtable Tracker Toolkit`,
  organization: `Test Organization Name`,
  city: `Detroit`,
  state: `Michigan`,
  boundingBox: [-83.287803, 42.25496, -82.910427, 42.45023],
  primary: '#9ADCFF',
  secondary: '#FFF89A',
  tertiary: '#FFB2A6',
}
```
