# How to use this guide

## What will it help you do, and who is it for?

This guide walks through the process of creating a simple data-driven news app to track real estate development by collecting data and setting it up in Airtable, connecting it to a front-end site, with open-source templates you can use and modify.

It also includes tips for managing your app and data, as well as links to other helpful resources

It is designed for small publishers who want to serve and engage readers around development in their community. It assumes you have the capacity to research, manage and vet a data journalism project, as well as some development experience, or the ability to hire for it on a project basis.

It is based on our experience with the Detroit Development Tracker and will be most applicable for cases where you want to host many records that users can search or browse and look up more information. It will work for records tied to locations or not TK. It includes reader engagement functions, so you can include callouts and users can submit tips (in our case, about real estate development activity; but has applications if you’re trying to continue reporting on a subject TK ProPublica example). It will work for static/complete data sets as well as ones you create or need to update ongoing

Simple setup if you want to do 1:1 - more customization requires more original coding. Airtable great for simpler projects and easy data management – more complex projects not necessarily served by this setup - and we are considering moving the Detroit Development Tracker to a new content management system.
