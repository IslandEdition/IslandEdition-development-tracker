# Publishing the site

You've finished making some changes to the data in [your base], and you're ready to publish your site to the internet.

The easiest way to get your site up and running is with a hosting provider, such as Netlify.

## Configuring Netlify

1. [Sign up](https://app.netlify.com/signup) for a Netlify account - it's easiest if you log in with GitHub, since you'll eventually link your GitHub site repository to your Netlify account.
2. Once in Netlify, click the "Add new site" dropdown and choose "Import an existing project".
3. You'll be prompted to log in to GitHub.
4. Next, you can choose a repository to build the site from. Choose the development tracker repository that you created.
5. Use the following settings:

<Image src={netlifyRepoBuildSettings} width={575} height={500} />

6. Under advanced build settings, add your environment variables, from your `.env.development.local` file.

<Image src={netlifyRepoEnvVar} width={600} height={300} />

7. Finally, click 'Deploy site'.
8. Netlify will build your site, and deploy it! This process takes a few minutes.

## Configuring your site's domain

In Netlify, navigate to your site settings.

Under "Domain management > Domains" from the sidebar, click "Add custom domain".
