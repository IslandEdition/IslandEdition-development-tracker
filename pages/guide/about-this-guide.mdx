# About this guide
This guide is based on the [Detroit Development Tracker](https://developmenttracker.detourdetroiter.com/), a news app built by Detour Detroit and now maintained by [Outlier Media](https://outliermedia.org/). The guide was produced for and with support from the [Reynolds Journalism Institute](https://rjionline.org/). 

We started building the Detroit Development Tracker in 2021 with the goal to empower Detroiters to better understand the forces shaping their own neighborhoods. As development activity skyrockets in the city, we believe residents deserve more information about what is being built, and who is building it.

We hope that tracking larger scale residential and commercial development projects will give Detroiters another layer of understanding about land use and ownership in their neighborhoods. The Detroit Development Tracker takes this information out of the domain of developers, funders and city bureaucracy, making it more accessible — and actionable — for those most impacted by it.

The tracker launched in beta in February 2022. We started building it a year earlier, with funding from RJI and essential support from Jimmy McBroom, a Detour member and civic engineer leading development on the project, but we did not have a full-time developer, data journalist or product team on our staff. Detour, which recently joined with Outlier, was a small local startup with a micro-budget that made it difficult to take on new resource- and time-intensive reporting projects without dedicated funding. We know, from our relationships with other publishers in groups like Local Independent Online News and the Institute for Nonprofit News, that our situation isn’t unique. 

So as we built the Detroit Development Tracker, we thought about how we could make it useful for others. Enter this template site and guide – which, we hope, will let you create a development tracker with relatively limited support needed on the design and development side, so you can focus on the reporting. 

The development tracker is one template for data-driven, equitable real estate and development journalism for underserved communities that you can use to strengthen your service journalism and relationships with readers while filling information gaps. 

If that sounds like a project that might benefit your newsroom, readers and community, we hope you’ll give it a try, and tell us how it goes. Read on to see how.
