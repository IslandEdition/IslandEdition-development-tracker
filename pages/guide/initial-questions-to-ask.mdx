# Initial questions to ask
* How does building a news app tracking local real estate development fit in with your organization’s mission?
* How does a development tracker serve readers, and how will you involve them in the project? 
* Put another way – does your audience and community need or want this? 
* Do you have the necessary development experience to set up and maintain your app? 
* Do you have the necessary capacity to create and manage your data? 
* From whom do you need buy-in and assistance to launch and maintain the app? 
* Who will be responsible for different pieces of the project, and will they have capacity with their other obligations?
* How will you sustain the tracker – will you apply for grants, encourage readers support and/or seek sponsorship and ad revenue? How can you start making the case for funding now?
