# Toolkit: Build a news app to track local real estate development 
This is a blank, open-source template site you can customize to build a real estate development tracker for your city. It is designed for small local news publishers who want to bootstrap a news app, but anyone is welcome to try it out. Read the [guide](./guide) to learn how and get started. All pages other than the guide are blank, or use sample data or text. 

This site was built by Jimmy McBroom and Kate Abbey-Lambertz as part of her Reynolds Journalism Institute fellowship through [Detour Detroit](https://detourdetroiter.com/). It is based on their work building the [Detroit Development Tracker](https://developmenttracker.detourdetroiter.com/), now maintained by [Outlier Media](https://outliermedia.org/). 

When you build your site, you will be able to explore development projects on the [map](./map),
see a list of [all projects](./projects) and
let users suggest developments to add to the tracker by [submitting a tip](./submit-a-tip).
